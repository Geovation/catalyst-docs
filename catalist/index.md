# Catalist

Catalist is our list of useful data sources, categorised by key themes, browsable via the table of contents on this page.

For each dataset, we compile metadata for:

- Dataset name
- Description
- Primary category and secondary category (themes)
- Primary and secondary access method (i.e. file format or API)
- Licensing (either open or premium)
- Data link
- Documentation link

## Maintenance

We have compiled the original list of data, which is maintained as a CSV spreadsheet file within our Catalist GitHub repository.

- [GitHub Repository: Catalist](https://github.com/Geovation/catalist)

We welcome people to contribute to the list, either to:

- suggest data sources that we haven't covered
- amend existing information

For the technically minded, you can edit the data and raise a pull request for us to accept, or feel free to get in touch to advise us of any changes.
