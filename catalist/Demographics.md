## Real-Time Location Estimates

Near-real-time population count estimates, broken down by age, gender, home & work, international visitors and percentage of the dwelling population compared to the moving population. Data updated every 15 minutes. Figures aggregated to H3 grid size 10 (each hex is ~1.5% of a square kilometer), or to LSOA. BT supplies related products for footfall to/from specific locations of interest. Other mobile network providers offer similar products:

## "Spatial Signatures"

The result of a research project (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01640-8) which has subdivided Great Britain into 'spatial signatures' - contiguous clusters of land enclosures which broadly share both form and function. Machine learning, clustering, and other data processing has been used to generate the dataset, and the code used in the research has also been published on Github (see second data link). There are 16 'spatial signature' categories, which primarily relate to human geography rather than natural geography. Note that the reserach was published in 2022 and the currency of the data will not necessarily be maintained.
